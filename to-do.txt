1. sort and transform temp4 so it only shows fastest, also transform and save as csv for qgis

2. stops_t ? right now a lot of stations dont have parent stations / no location_type. WÃ¼rzburg e.g. what to use as input then??? remove last digits from stop_id?

3. time_calculation. When the DATETIME values have not the correct format traveltime will become NULL. it often misses the first digit ( its 4:44:44 but should be 04:44:44)
